I built a fully autonomous AI Solopreneur for $0/mo.

It scouts trends, writes threads, captures leads, and even sells products 24/7.

No employees. No paid tools. Just Python + Google Gemini.

Here is the entire system architecture 👇

The hardest part of being a creator? Consistency.

You have to:
1. Research trends (Hours)
2. Write content (Hours)
3. Engagement with replies (Hours)
4. Build products (Weeks)

Stop trading time for money. Automate it.

Meet the **AI Solopreneur Bot**.

It’s not just a script. It’s a 7-module autonomous agent.

1. **Trend Brain**: Scrapes Reddit/Google Trends
2. **Content Engine**: Gemini High-Speed Generation
3. **Auto-Poster**: Optimized scheduling
4. **Sales Agent**: Turning likes into leads

Here's how the logic flows:

🧠 **Module 1: Trend Discovery**

Most bots just spam generic quotes.
This bot uses a "Niche Brain" algorithm.

It scans r/ArtificialIntelligence, Google Trends, and GitHub.
It only picks topics with:
✅ High recent velocity
✅ Low competition
✅ Relevance to YOUR audience

🗣️ **Module 2: Content Generation**

Goodbye, ChatGPT-3.5 wrappers.
I integrated **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**.

Why?
- It's FREE (up to 15 RPM)
- It has a massive context window
- It creates sharp, witty, non-robotic hooks.

It writes threads that actually get read.

📈 **Module 3: Auto-Engagement**

Posting is only half the battle.
The bot tracks who likes/retweets your best content.

It keeps a database of "Warm Leads" and uses AI to draft personalized DM templates to start conversations.

It’s like having a 24/7 SDR working for free.

💰 **Module 4: Product Generator**

This is the killer feature.
The bot analyzes your top-performing tweets of the month.

It compiles them into a PDF "Guide", generates a cover, and uploads it to **Gumroad**.
It then tweets the link to your new product.

Passive income loop: COMPLETE. ✅
